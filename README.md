and generate a comprehensive report.
Detailed Task Breakdown:.

• Deploy Selenium to access an e-commerce site.

• Execute a product search for &quot;Hindi Books&quot; and scrape details such as
the name, price, and user rating of the books.

• Organize the scraped data in a structured JSON or CSV format.

• Mobile Interaction Using Appium:

• Set up Appium to engage with a mobile application displaying a product
list with prices.

• Capture a screenshot of this product list directly from the app.

• Text Extraction with OCR:

• Apply OCR technology on the screenshot to extract product names and
prices.

• Match the OCR-derived data with the Selenium-scraped data to identify
any price discrepancies.

• Data Comparison and Report Generation:

the two methods.
